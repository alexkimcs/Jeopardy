# Jeopardy
Jeopardy is an interactive game where players can choose catyegories with varying difficulty.

I would suggest chekcing the console for answers

## Objectives
The goals of this project was to use an API to grab categories and eloquently render them into functioning Jeopardy game.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Challenges
Having eveythingh be rendered dynamically was the biggest challge.
Some features don't work fully they way I wanted to such as the score counter updating correcty and the answer to reveal.
